      <h4>MIMIC</h4>
      <p>Mimics are shapeshifting predators that take the forms of inanimate objects to lure intelligent creatures to their doom. However, very rarely, a mimic will be born with higher intelligence on par with its erstwhile prey. It may even, eventually, find that the taste of sentient beings isn't to its liking, or that staying in one place and waiting for a hapless adventurer to happen by has lost its charm. Such an unnatural specimen may then choose to leave its domain and seek out other creatures not merely for food, but for conversation and companionship.</p> 
      <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Age.</span>Mimics reach what passes for adulthood at around 10, but can live as long as a century.<br/>
	  <span class="feature">Alignment</span>Mimics tend toward neutrality, but may find purpose and inspiration in whatever culture or person they encounter and be of any alignment.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Size.</span>A mimic's true form is amorphous, but can draw itself up to a height of about 5 feet. Your size is Medium.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Darkvision.</span>Alecani are adapted for living and flying at twilight hours. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Adhesive.</span>Due to the sticky nature of your body, ability checks made to escape your grapple have disadvantage.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Amorphous.</span>Due to the amorphous nature of your true form, you cannot benefit from armor, though you can use a shield. Your Armor Class is equal to 11 + your Dexterity modifier and you are immune to the prone condition.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Bite.</span>Your maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Grappler.</span>You have advantage on grapple checks. In addition, whenever a Large or smaller creature interacts with you or enters a space within 5 feet of you, while you have shape changed into an object, you can use your reaction to attempt to grapple that creature.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Monstrosity.</span>Your creature type is both humanoid and monstrosity.<br/>
      <span class="feature">Shapechanger.</span>As an action, you can polymorph into an object of your Medium or Small size that you have seen, or back into your true form. While you remain motionless, as an object you are indistinguishable from an ordinary object. Your equipment does not change with you, however, it may be contained within you as long as your shape has the dimensions to accommodate it. If you die, you revert to your true form. You retain all of your normal statistics while in this form.<br/>
